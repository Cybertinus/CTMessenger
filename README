CTMessenger - a simple Qt based messenger

The purpose of this program is to have a very simple application running on
every machine in your LAN to make it very easy to relay simple messages.
The idea for this program comes from the Windows 98 program called WinPopup.
WinPopup was also used for simple, small messages over the local LAN. In modern
Windows versions (Windows 7 and 8) the core functionality is still available,
the famous 'net send'. But WinPopup also had a GUI, and I wanted that too, so
I created CTMessenger. But with a twist to make it a bit more easily to use
(I think/hope)

The program opens a TCP and a UDP socket, both on port 1337. The TCP port is
used for the actual messages that are send from computer to computer. The UDP
port is used for keep-alive kind of messages. Every minute CTMessenger
broadcasts that it is still alive. Other instances receive those broadcasts
mark the corresponding host as up and add it to the list of possible computers
you can send an message to. If the last keep-alive message was received a few
minutes ago, the computer is removed from the list. Also when a 'down' message
is broadcasted, the computer is removed from the list.

Please note: this application is intended for use in small, fully trusted LANs
like home situations. There is little to no security in place. The messages are
send in plain text (no SSL encryption) and there is no protection against mass
messaging. In other words: only use in a small LAN environment, where you can
physically smack the person who is abusing this problem ;).
